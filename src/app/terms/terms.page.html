                We understand that you do not want to share sensitive and personal information as it is important for you. But we make sure to keep your privacy intact as we care for our customers. Our privacy policy shows how we use the information that

                Both the seller and the company process customer’s personal information and therefore the data is controlled separately under the law. In other&nbsp;words, it means, both the parties are individually responsible for the processing&nbsp;of
                    the data while providing the services. For instance; if your personal information is shared incidentally by the seller while fulfilling other buyer’s order, the seller and not Poncube will be responsible for the disclosure.

                However, in a situation when the&nbsp;seller, as well as the company, is found to be joint controller of the buyer’s information and if you sue Poncube or if the company incur expenses because of something that the seller did as a joint
                    controller of the buyer’s personal information, you agree to indemnify Products of Nigeria for the expenses incurred in connection with the processing of the personal information.
